## BACKEND ENGINEER | SENIOR FULLSTACK ENGINEER

## Live Coding Session

### INSTRUCTION

Below is an outline of what to expect and recommended preparation for
the Live Coding interview.

In this interview you will be expected to solve small
problems. The interview focuses on algorithms and data
structures. You’ll be expected to know and apply: lists,
maps, stacks, priority queues, trees, graphs, bags, and
sets. You’ll need to be able to talk about how they’re
implemented and why you’d choose one
implementation or data structure instead of another.
For algorithms, you’ll need to know greedy algorithms,
divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion,
backtracking, and brute force search. You’ll definitely
need to be familiar with Big O notation, running time
and space complexity.

Additionally, you'll be asked to answer some technical
questions related to algorithms, data structures and
testing

**Important:** Please bring your laptop and an IDE
prepared with an empty project already setup in a
framework of your choice, so that you can write and
execute your solution, with unit tests. **We expect you
to write test cases. So, don't forget to setup the unit
tests frameworks of your choice.** You will be sharing
your screen to show your work to the interviewers.

We hope this helps & whilst we appreciate that it's a lot of information,
we’d rather you be over prepared than under-prepared.

Good luck with the preparation !
